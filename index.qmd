## FYP: Heartland Orientation Trail Games

One of my most exciting projects is my **Final Year Project (FYP)**, where I developed and enhanced multiple Phaser games for the **Peopleâ€™s Association Heartland Orientation Trail Website**. This project aimed to engage over 300 Permanent Residents (PRs) and non-residents, helping them assimilate into Singaporeâ€™s culture and explore its places of interest.

### Project Highlights:

-   **Game Development**: Designed and enhanced **Phaser games** to improve user engagement and learning.
-   **Technology Proficiency**: Utilized programming languages like Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C#, and SQL for development and data analysis.
-   **Deployment**: Deployed the website on **Firebase** for real-time database management.
-   **Impact**: Improved user engagement and learning experience by **45%**.
